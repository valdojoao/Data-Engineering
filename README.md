# Data Engineering Task

This is a Data Analytics task in which I play a bit with the standard tools to get the job done. The data for this task is received as a stream of events related to an individuals browsing behaviour with each event having a number of properties.<br>

The task covers several aspects such as:<br>
1)How to Analyse Data <br>
2)How to interogate a JSON content <br>
3)How to use Regular Expressions or Text Mining to identify urls inside an Html code <br>
4)How to design a Classification Model <br>
5)How to deal with Imbalanced Data <br>
6)How to use Bayesian inteligent search to find the best Hyper-Parameters combination
