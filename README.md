# Data Engineering Task

This is a Data Analytics task in which I play a bit with the standard tools to get the job done. The data for this task is received as a stream of events related to an individuals browsing behaviour with each event having a number of properties.

The task covers several aspects such as:
1)How to Analyse Data 
2)How to interogate a JSON content 
3)How to use Regular Expressions or Text Mining to identify urls inside an Html code
4)How to design a Classification Model 
5)How to deal with Imbalanced Data
6)How to use Bayesian inteligent search to find the best Hyper-Parameters combination
